# 👁 Vision

**An increasingly ubiquitous digital identity protocol for increasing number of everyday use cases**

An **increasingly ubiquitous**, **digital identity** protocol, that empowers **consumers** to **use and manage their identity**, without involvement of a trusted **third party**, and that benefits other digital economy stakeholders such as businesses and governments.

## 🧩 Problem

### 🆔🧩 Digital identity fragmentation problem

- 🙍‍♀️🧩 Consumer experience broken - So many passwords, personal data management and privacy, friction and limitations across services/devices/ecosystems/use-cases- (evidenced by the exploding password management industry)
- 🏢🙍‍♀️✅ Enterprise validation and verification challenges - Multi-trillion dollar IAM and Identity Verification industries, partly due to fragmented identity landscape
- 📱🧪 Building new and innovative services is broken - Fragmented identity silos each controlled by large players, adds significant friction or prevents innovation completely
- 🏢🧩 Business models are broken - Allows certain players to lock people in, such that innovative business models cannot emerge, inability for others to compose innovative business models, and capture their own value

## 🙌 Solution

**🌎🆔 Universal identity protocol** - that is:

- 🤳🆔 Self-sovereign - Controlled by ID owners
- 📜🆔 Standards-based - Based on a ubiquitous  common logical structure
- 🔗🆔 Federated - When necessary, supports different jurisdictional governance approaches
- 🔢🆔 Versioned - Supports changes through time
- 📶🆔 Increasing use case coverage - Evolves in time to cover increasing number of digital identity use cases

## 🎯 Goals

- **Digital identity for the masses** - Provide everyday people with a usable (requiring minimal cognitive load) digital self-sovereign identity protocol and third-party identity apps.
- **🔒 Security** - Not only should the solution be technically secure against unauthorized exploits, it should also guarantee decentralization and protect against collusion by stakeholders to take advantage of others.
- **Decentralization** - Preventing of capture and rent-seeking behavior, the same behaviors that have fragmented Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 digital identity.
- **Personal data privacy** - Identity owners are in full control of personal data and decide the extent to which it is shared. The choices are enforceable through social and national governance.
- **Ubiquitous adoption** - An identity protocol cannot be easy-to-use if it is not widely adopted by a network of people and organizations, and it is not widely adopted if doesn't grow past a tipping point, where mainstream digital ecosystem players are incentivized to support it.
- **🧠 Intuitiveness** - The standard concepts and protocol operation are in harmony with human cognitive processes when considering topics of identity, security and privacy.

## ☑️ Desirable traits

- **Interoperable** - Entities functioning on the same protocol can interoperate seamlessly.
- **Federatable** - New instances of the protocol can be governed separately, while remaining interoperable with other protocol instances, as long as both follow the same standards.
- **Transferrable** - Owner of a specific identity can easily transfer between different types of service providers.
- **Permission minimized and censorship resistant by default** - Although specific protocol governance could effectively restrict some levels of access, the protocols should allow anyone to participate by default.
- **🦸‍♂️ Private identity supported by default** - Although specific protocol governance could effectively restrict some levels of access, the protocols should allow the use of private (anonymous or pseudonymous) identities by default.

## 🕰 Long term trend assumptions

- **Self-sovereign identity** - Introduction of truly self-sovereign digital identity will disrupt all digital economic activity based on the following aspects:
  - **Consumer experience** - The cost of managing passwords, personal data and privacy, as well as the friction consumer face across services, devices, ecosystems and use-cases.
    - **Passwords and accounts**
    - **Personal data and privacy**
    - **🕸 Digital graph**
  - **Enterprise validation and verification** - The large cost of economic activity related to Identity Access Management (IAM) and Identity Verification, can be significantly improved and disrupted.
  - **Software development limitations** - Current fragmented identity ecosystem, and lack of logical and programmatic uniformity drastically increases implementation complexity. With significantly improvements, development can scale and reduces total costs by orders of magnitude.
  - **Business model limitations** - Current fragmented identity landscape, allows certain players to lock people in. Fixing this will allow disruptive business models to emerge, unlocking enormous economic value.
